# Telegram Dictionary Bot

This is a simple Telegram bot that fetches word meanings from an online dictionary API and responds to user queries. The bot is built using the `python-telegram-bot` library.

## Features
- **Word Lookup**: Use `/meaning [word]` to fetch the definition, part of speech, and example usage of the word.
- **Commands**:
  - `/start`: Greet the user.
  - `/help`: Display available commands and usage instructions.
  - `/description`: Describe the bot's functionality.
  - `/contact`: Provide contact information (e.g., GitHub link).

## How It Works
1. Users send commands to the bot, such as `/meaning ant`.
2. The bot extracts the word from the command and queries an online dictionary API (e.g., [dictionaryapi.dev](https://dictionaryapi.dev)).
3. The API returns the word's meanings, part of speech, and example usage, which the bot formats and sends back to the user.
